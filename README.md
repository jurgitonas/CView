# CView
A simple Swift App to view CVs

If you want to load Sample file `Documents\cvs.data`, with CView running in Simulator, open Terminal and type `xcrun simctl get_app_container booted io.jurgitonas.CView data` and replace it.

This app was created after reading part of [Develop Apps for iOS
](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) and is based on it.
